# SwiftUI-Login-Firebase
My result after following the tutorial by Kavsoft, available on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiCTgsH0dtk

To install firebase with Cocoapods, please open terminal and navigate to the project file. Then,

```bash
$ pod install
```

After that, you can open Xcode with the following command (make sure you have the Xcode CLI installed):

```bash
$ xed .
```
